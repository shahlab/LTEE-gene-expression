An easier way to prep for packrat is to simply find all of the library statements in all of the Rmds. This bash code does that.
```{bash}
for file in code/*/*.Rmd; do # for each of the Rmd files
  egrep "library\(" $file    # find lines that contain library(
done | sort | uniq           # find only unique entries
```

You can simply copy and paste these into a chunk and use packrat on this Rmd
```{r}
library(Biostrings)
library(broom)
library(clusterProfiler)
library(corrr)
library(DESeq2)
library(feather)
library(GenomicAlignments)
library(ggforce)
library(ggpointdensity)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggridges)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(multitaper)
library(org.EcK12.eg.db)
library(parallel)
library(patchwork)
library(png)
library(riborex)
library(rtracklayer)
library(tidyverse)
library(topGO)
```
